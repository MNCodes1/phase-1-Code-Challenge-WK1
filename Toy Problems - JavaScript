This project contains solutions to three JavaScript challenges. Each challenge is organized in its own file.
#1. Student Grade Generator
Prompts the user to input student marks.
 Outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:  
   A: > 79  
   B: 60 to 79  
   C: 50 to 59  
   D: 40 to 49  
   E: less than 40
   #2. Speed Detector
    Takes the speed of a car as input.  
If the speed is below 70, outputs "Ok".  
For every 5 km above 70, the driver gets 1 demerit point.  
If the points exceed 12, the function returns "license suspended".
